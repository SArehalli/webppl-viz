**Work in progress**

Some visualization functions for WebPPL running in the browser.

Right now, only defines `viz.print`, which takes an ERP and makes a sort of reasonable set of plots.

Compiling:

```sh
make demo/webppl-viz.js
```

Watchified compiling (incrementally rebuilds after source files have updated):

```sh
make watch
```
